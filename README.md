# A simple and safe password checker.

Safely check locally if you password has ever been breached or pwned/hacked. Thi script is simply getting you password, keeping it locally, it uses SHA1 encripting algorithm to safely than compare it to the passwords online and find out fo you if you password is safe to use or you should change it.

How to use it:
Open a terminal in the location you have the script, or copy the path into your teminal and run the command:

$yourPATH/Foder/etc: python checkmypass.py PASSWORD

PASSWORD = your password you want to check if it safe to use or not.

* using this script you don't have to type you password into different websites you don't now nothing about and you keep you passowrds stored in you computer all the time. 
*before it checks the password the script is encripting the password and compares the encripted version whith other passwords online.
When you type you password on a website it gets stored into a server, and if that server gets hacked your password gets leaked.
